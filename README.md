### The impact of the "100% Santé" health plan on the French healthcare system
In the context of our econometrics research project, we are analyzing the impact of the "100% Santé" plan on the French healthcare system.

The "100% Santé" plan was implemented in January 2021 within the French healthcare system. Its objective was to facilitate access to healthcare for everyone, specifically targeting optical, dental, and hearing care. Our study aims to assess whether the plan has been effective since its implementation in 2021, and to identify any additional positive or negative effects it may have had.

To see the results, you can take a look at the regression-reference2017.ipynb file. You'll be able to see all of the regression on the data.

If you want to see how did we filter and sort the data, you can take a look at filtering_data.ipynb, functions.py, work_on_dental_field.ipynb, mean.ipynb and governmental-expenditures.ipynb files. 
The main idea is available on functions.py file, you'll be able to understand how does it work in general.
